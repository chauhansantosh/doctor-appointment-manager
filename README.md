System for Booking Doctorâ€™s Appointment


Certainly! Let's break down Step 7 into detailed instructions for implementing the backend logic in Golang. This step involves developing the logic for user authentication, doctor search, appointment booking, cancellation, and notifications. Additionally, you'll implement API endpoints for frontend-backend communication and use Cloud Endpoints to expose these APIs securely.

### 7.1. Backend Logic Implementation:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement user authentication logic using Firebase Authentication.
   - Validate user credentials (HCL-email or Employee Code) against the `Patients` table in your PostgreSQL database.

2. **Doctor Search:**
   - Create a Golang function to handle doctor searches based on location and specialization.
   - Query the `Doctors` and `Specializations` tables in your PostgreSQL database to retrieve relevant information.

3. **Appointment Booking:**
   - Implement logic to allow users to book appointments.
   - Check the availability of the selected doctor at the specified date and time in the `AvailableDatesTime` table.
   - If available, create a new record in the `BookedAppointments` table.

4. **Appointment Cancellation:**
   - Allow users to cancel their booked appointments.
   - Validate cancellation requests and delete the corresponding record from the `BookedAppointments` table.

5. **Notification Logic:**
   - Implement logic to send notifications (email, SMS, or push notifications) for appointment confirmations and cancellations.
   - Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications.
   - For email notifications, consider using a third-party email service or Google's Gmail API.

### 7.2. API Endpoints:

1. **Create API Endpoints:**
   - Define API endpoints in your Golang application for user authentication, doctor search, appointment booking, and cancellation.
   - Use a web framework such as Gorilla Mux to handle HTTP routing.

2. **Secure Endpoints:**
   - Implement security measures for your API endpoints. For example, use Firebase Authentication to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints.

### 7.3. Cloud Endpoints:

1. **Create OpenAPI Specification:**
   - Define an OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger) for your API. This document describes the structure of your API, including endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

2. **Deploy Cloud Endpoints:**
   - Deploy your OpenAPI Specification using Google Cloud Endpoints.
   - This process generates a proxy for your API, allowing you to manage and secure the API easily.
